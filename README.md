# BankSim: Central Banking Operations Simulation Platform

BankSim is a comprehensive, open-source simulation platform that models the complete operational ecosystem of a central bank with specific adaptations for developing economies like Bangladesh. This high-fidelity simulation environment replicates the complex interplay between monetary policy, financial regulation, economic indicators, and market behaviors, allowing for sophisticated scenario planning, policy testing, and educational applications.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop BankSim, encompassing:

 
- A Core Simulation Engine (Monetary Policy, Banking Supervision, Financial Stability, Foreign Exchange & Reserves)
- Economic Modeling Components (DSGE, Macro-Financial Linkages, Bangladesh-Specific Adaptations)
- Robust Technical Infrastructure (Data Layer, Computational Core, API & Integration, Frontend)

For full details, please refer to the project planning documentation.
